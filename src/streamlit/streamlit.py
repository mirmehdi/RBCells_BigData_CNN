        Peripheral blood cells, including erythrocytes, leukocytes, and thrombocytes, play crucial roles in oxygen transport and immune 
             defense. They constitute about 45% of blood volume, with the remaining 55% being plasma. The analysis of peripheral blood cells serves as a critical diagnostic tool, with morphological examination being the cornerstone for identifying over 80% of haematological diseases, such as anaemia, leukaemia, or lymphoma.

    st.header("Problematic")
    st.write("""
        Traditional diagnostic methods for blood diseases rely on manual inspection by haematologists, which is laborious, time-consuming, and prone to subjectivity. Automated systems exist but often cannot match human expertise, particularly in detecting subtle morphological differences indicative of diseases like leukemia. 
        Traditional machine learning methods show promise but fail to generalize well to diverse datasets.

    st.header("Aim")
    st.write("""
        To address these limitations, we propose using convolutional neural network (CNN) models for the automatic classification of peripheral blood cells. Our goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify and classify various blood cell types, reducing the need for manual intervention. This system aims to streamline
         the diagnostic process for haematological diseases, improving efficiency and accuracy in clinical practice.
