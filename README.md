# Peripheral Blood Cell Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop an automatic recognition system for classifying peripheral blood cell images into different cell types. The dataset used in this project consists of microscopic images of individual normal cells, acquired from the Core Laboratory at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona. The dataset is organized into eight groups: neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, immature granulocytes, erythroblasts, and platelets or thrombocytes.

## Objective
To identify the different types of blood cells using computer vision algorithms. To develop tools or system that can accurately identify and classify different type of blood cells in smear images using computer vision algorithms. 

## Goal
Its primary goal is to leverage computer vision techniques to automate the process of analyzing blood smears and aid in diagnosis of various pathologies, such as leukemia. By accurately identifying and quantifying blood cell types, the tool can assist medical professionals in assessing the density and relative abundance of cells, which is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring certain diseases.

## Dataset Description
- **Total Images:** 17,092
- **Image Size:** 360 x 363 pixels (JPG format)
- **Annotation:** Expert clinical pathologists annotated the images.
- **Categories:** Neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, immature granulocytes (promyelocytes, myelocytes, and metamyelocytes), erythroblasts, and platelets or thrombocytes.
- **Image Source:** Individuals without infection, hematologic or oncologic disease, and free of any pharmacologic treatment at the moment of blood collection.
