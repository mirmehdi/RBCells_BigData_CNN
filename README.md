# Peripheral Blood Cell Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop an automatic recognition system for classifying peripheral blood cell images into different cell types. The dataset used in this project consists of microscopic images of individual normal cells, acquired from the Core Laboratory at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona. The dataset is organized into eight groups: neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, immature granulocytes, erythroblasts, and platelets or thrombocytes.

## Dataset Description
- **Total Images:** 17,092
- **Image Size:** 360 x 363 pixels (JPG format)
- **Annotation:** Expert clinical pathologists annotated the images.
- **Categories:** Neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, immature granulocytes (promyelocytes, myelocytes, and metamyelocytes), erythroblasts, and platelets or thrombocytes.
- **Image Source:** Individuals without infection, hematologic or oncologic disease, and free of any pharmacologic treatment at the moment of blood collection.
