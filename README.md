# Peripheral Blood Cell Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop an automatic recognition system for classifying peripheral blood cell images into different cell types. The dataset used in this project consists of microscopic images of individual normal cells, acquired from the Core Laboratory at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona. The dataset is organized into eight groups: neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, immature granulocytes, erythroblasts, and platelets or thrombocytes.

## Objective
To identify the different types of blood cells using computer vision algorithms. The density and relative abundance of blood cells in the smears is crucial for the diagnosis of many pethologies. identification of abnormal leukocytes in pathologies such as leukemid.
to develop a tool capable of analyzing cells from blood smears to facilitate the diagnosis of certain pathologies.

## Dataset Description
- **Total Images:** 17,092
- **Image Size:** 360 x 363 pixels (JPG format)
- **Annotation:** Expert clinical pathologists annotated the images.
- **Categories:** Neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, immature granulocytes (promyelocytes, myelocytes, and metamyelocytes), erythroblasts, and platelets or thrombocytes.
- **Image Source:** Individuals without infection, hematologic or oncologic disease, and free of any pharmacologic treatment at the moment of blood collection.
